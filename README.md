-  Use Newton's method to solve the roots of the equation and calculate its error and convergence

  - 1. Use quadratic Lagrangian interpolation for exponential functions, compare their concavity and convexity, and calculate the error

  - 2. Write code to observe the run phenomenon, perform high-order polynomial interpolation for $f=1/(1+x^2)$, and calculate the error in a specific interval

- Numerical integration part

  - 3. Apply the midpoint, trapezoidal, and Simpson's composite rules to approximate the integral of exponential function discuss their convergence (both theoretically predicted and practically achieved) as a function of the size h of the subintervals.
    4.  Estimate the minimum number m of subintervals that is needed for computing exponential integral up to an absolute error using the composite trapezoidal and Simpson's rulesï¼ŒEvaluate in both cases the absolute error.
    5. Using the trapezoidal rule with 9 different subdivisions,
       determine empirically its rate of convergence for the evaluation of the integral of $\int_{0}^{1} x^{\alpha }lnx$ for different alpha.

- Curve Fitting part

  -    6 .  Write a program to interpolate the hat function by trigonometric polynomials Measure maximum absolute error on the mesh and experimental rate of Convergence.

-  Numerical differentiation part

  - 7. Using Taylor's expansions derive a sixth order method for approximating the second derivative of a given smooth function, approximate the second derivative of exponential function multiplied by trigonometric function, verifying its order by different mesh
